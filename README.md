# Assignment Seven: PLLKIA010

## Makefile
The purpose of the Makefile is to automatically compile and link the C++ source files into a binary executable that can be run locally. Run these commands in sequence to interact with the program.
```make``` will compile the files into an executable called ```driver```

```make run``` will run the executable and write the Neural Network prediction results to the console.
Answers to the assignment questions are contained in the ```results.txt``` file.

## neural_network.h

This is a header file that contains the ```NeuralNetwork``` Class declaration.


## neural_network.cpp

This file is the actual implementation of the methods declared in the ```neural_network.h``` file. The implementation of the methods is explained below. 

## perceptron.h

This is a header file that contains the ```Perceptron``` Class declaration.


## perceptron.cpp

This file is the actual implementation of the methods declared in the ```perceptron.h``` file. The implementation of the methods is explained below. 

## layer.h

This is a header file that contains the ```Layer``` Class declaration.


## layer.cpp

This file is the actual implementation of the methods declared in the ```layer.h``` file. The implementation of the methods is explained below. 

## data.h

This is a header file that contains the ```Data``` Class declaration.


## data.cpp

This file is the actual implementation of the methods declared in the ```data.h``` file. The implementation of the methods is explained below. 

## input.h

This is a header file that contains the ```Input``` Class declaration.


## input.cpp

This file is the actual implementation of the methods declared in the ```input.h``` file. The implementation of the methods is explained below. 


## driver.cpp

This file contains the main method, and provides an entry point into the program. It imports the ```neural_network.h``` file in order to provide the artifical neural network functionality. The main method has a ```NeuralNetwork``` object.
